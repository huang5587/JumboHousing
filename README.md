# JumboHousing

# Summary

JumboHousing is a web-app that seeks to match sublettors (people who have rooms to offer) with sublessee (people who need rooms).

Sublettors can list their room and it will be displayed on the map. 

Sublessee will be able to search for rooms according to their desired specifications (dates, cost, location, facilities, all-female etc etc).

Users can create a log in with a profile and communicate with prospective tenants. 

Once a sublettor has found a tenant, they can change their availabilty letting others know that the room is no longer availabe.
